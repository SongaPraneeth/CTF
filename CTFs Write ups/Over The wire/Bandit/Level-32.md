Level Goal:

After all this `git` stuff, it’s time for another escape. Good luck!

Steps to solve:

Step1: As we know that the it is uppercase shell, now lets change the shell to `/bin/bash` 

step2: So lets change the shell using export the command will be `export SHELL=/bin/bash`

step3: Lets see whether the shell has changed using the command `echo $SHELL`, this command will tell, what `SHELL` the `SHELL` has been set to . So now we have set to /bin/bash

step4: Now lets run the shell using command `$SHELL` and now you will get the bash shell

step5: Now you can just read the password which is present in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit33`, you can directly read using `cat  /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33`
