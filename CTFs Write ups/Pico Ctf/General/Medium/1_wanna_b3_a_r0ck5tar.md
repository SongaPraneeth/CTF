**Description:**

I wrote you another song. Put the flag in the picoCTF{} flag format.

**Steps to solve:**

step1: After downloading the song, open the file using `cat song.txt` and copy the song and paste in the `rock star` website and remove the lines that start with `if` and `else`, now press `enter` 

step2: Now you will get numbers, so copy that numbers and use any decimal to string converter website, and you will get the word, now the flag will be `picoCTF{BONJOVI}`
