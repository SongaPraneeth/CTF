**Description:**

Reception of Special has been cool to say the least. That's why we made an exclusive version of Special, called Secure Comprehensive Interface for Affecting Linux Empirically Rad, or just 'Specialer'. With Specialer, we really tried to remove the distractions from using a shell. Yes, we took out spell checker because of everybody's complaining. But we think you will be excited about our new, reduced feature set for keeping you focused on what needs it the most. Please start an instance to test your very own copy of Specialer.

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance

**steps to solve:**

step1: Here after connecting, we get to know that only few command can be used like `pwd` and `cd`

step2: So just type `cd` and press `tab` button and it will show the directories or folders present in the current directory and now we can see that there are three directories and these three directories have files and we cannot read because we can’t use `cat` command

step3: Now we have to write a program in `bash`, so that, we can enter each folder and print the content in the file, by doing this we will get the flag. See photos for code.
