**Description:**

To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with nc [jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org](http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/) 15130.

**Steps to solve:**

**Note**: it will not mention it is binary, or it is octal, or hex etc, you should identify it.

Step1: Run the command `nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 15130` 

step2: Now it will ask to convert `binary` to `string`, so use any binary to string converter

step3: After enter, it may give you any value and ask to convert to string.
