**Description:**

I wrote you a song. Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

**Steps to solve:** 

step1: Use `cat` command to see the lyrics use `cat lyrics.txt` and now copy the lyrics and paste in the `rockestar` website (https://codewithrockstar.com/online) and run , now you will get decimal numbers

step2: Copy and paste these numbers in `cyberchef` and you will get a string, now the flag will be picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
