Description:

Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker file and you'll need the encrypted file in the same directory too.

Steps to solve:

Step1: After you have download the both the files, we can see that one file is encrypted `level1.txt.enc` and another file is python file (password checker), `level1.py`

step2: Lets run the python file with command `python3 [level1.py](http://level1.py)` and after pressing we will see it is asking for the correct password, as we now don’t have the password just type random and press enter,

step3: Now lets see what is happening inside the python file using command `cat level1.py`

step3: In the python file we see two functions one function is getting the password from the encrypted file and another function is checking the user given password with the correct password,

step5: That's it we found the password, so now run the file and enter the correct password and you will get the flag
