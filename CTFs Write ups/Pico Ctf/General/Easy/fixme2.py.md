Description:
Fix the syntax error in the Python script to print the flag.

Steps to solve:

step1: Download the file and run the file using command `python3 fixme2.py`

step2: Now we will know where and what is the error, so use any preferred editor to edit it, here I’m using vim, `vim fixme2.py`

step3: After correcting, again run the file, now you will get the flag.
