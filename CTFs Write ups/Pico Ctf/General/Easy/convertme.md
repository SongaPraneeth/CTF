**Description**: 
Run the Python script and convert the given number from decimal to binary to get the flag.

**Steps to solve:**

step1: Run the python code using command `python3 convertme.py`

step2: After running the file, it will ask: If 76 is in `decimal` base, what is it in `binary` base?, 

it means you should enter `binary value` of asked number(number will be different every time you run the code)

step3: Now check what is the `binary value` of 76 using google and enter the value to get the flag.
