Description:
Have you heard of Rust? Fix the syntax errors in this Rust file to print the flag! Download the Rust code.

Steps to solve: 

step1: After downloading the we see that the file is compressed and archived, so first we use command `gzip -d fixme1.tar.gz` and `tar -xf fixme1.tar`

step2: After executing the above two commands we will get a directory, now enter the directory, using the command `cd fixme1` and we will find two files and a folder.

step3: To run the rusts file first we have to compile it, so use command `cargo build` and to run use command `cargo run`, now while compiling we will get a error called calling unsafe function

step4: Now use a editor and open the file and you will some comments and a link, open the link and read, now you will know what to do .
