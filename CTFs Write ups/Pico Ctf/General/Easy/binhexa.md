**Description**: 

How well can you perform basic binary operations?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

**Steps to solve:**

step1: After pressing launch instance, we will get a command `nc titan.picoctf.net 50421` (it can be different), run this command and you will get two binary numbers(binary numbers will be different, each time you run the command)

step2: Now there will be 6 question and for  each question it will ask you to perform certain operation on those given binary numbers.

step3: After solving those 6 questions, it will ask you to convert the solution of last question into hexadecimal and now enter the hexadecimal number you will get the flag.
