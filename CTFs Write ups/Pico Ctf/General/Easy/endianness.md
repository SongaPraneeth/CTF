Description:

Know of little and big endian? 

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Steps to solve:

Step1: Press launch instance will get a command  `nc titan.picoctf.net 53528` , copy this command and run on the terminal

step2: Now it will ask for `small endian`, by giving a random word.

step3: To find the `small endian` just find the `hexadecimal value` of that word and reverse it, it is `small endian`. Here the asked value is `bhoat`, its hexadecimal value is `62 68 6f 61 74` , its reverse is `74 61 6f 68 62`   , enter this value without spaces.

step4: Now enter the `big endian`, which is hexadecimal value of that word.
