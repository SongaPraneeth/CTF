**Description:**
The numbers... what do they mean?

**Steps to solve:**

step1: After downloading the file, we will know that it is a photo so open the photo

step2: Now we will see the numbers, so we can see that these numbers are not related to hex or decimal or any bases,

step3: We can observe that these are just numbers to letters(A=1, B=2, … Z=26)., so open a website that convert number to letter and enter the numbers in the photo and you will get the flag
