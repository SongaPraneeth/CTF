**Description:**

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/ (link) or [http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:15796](http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:15796/)

**Steps to solve:** 

step1: Open the website and enter username `Joe` and password `password123` and press `sign in`, but you will be told the password is super secure

step2: So lets try with other user name `admin` and password `admin123` , now try to `sign in` , and success, you will be signed in. But there is no flag,

step3: So lets open `inspector tab` and check `cookies` in the `storage`, here you will find `admin` is `False`, now change it to `True`, and refresh page, you will get the flag.
