**Description:**

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

**Steps to solve:**

step1: After launching the `instance`, open the website, in the website there is no flag

step2: So lets first try to find the flag from `source code`, so open the `source code` by right click and click `view page source`, here you will find the entire code in single line, now copy the entire line.

step3: Open any code formatter website to paste the `code` and after `formatting` the `code` you will find the flag in the `code`. Here we can argue that flag can be found at the single line source code, why format, but formatting the code will make the code clear and easy to find the flag, if available, here we found the flag.
