**Description:**

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/

**Steps to solve:**

Step 1:

Open the challenge website and enter any cookie name, such as `snickerdoodle`.

The page responds with something like:

**“**`I love snickerdoodle cookies!`**”**

Step 2:

Open `Developer Tools → Application → Cookies`.

Here you can see the cookie *name* and *value* used by the site.

Step 3:

Change the cookie value to `1` and refresh the page.

You’ll now see a different message (e.g., *“I love chocolate cookies!”*).

This tells us the cookie value controls the message — and one of these values will reveal the flag.

Step 4:

Open `Burp Suite`, enable `Intercept ON`, and refresh the page.

Burp will capture the request containing:

```
name=1
```

We do not know which value (1–100 or more) will return the flag, so we’ll use Burp Intruder to brute-force the cookie value.

Step 5:

Send the request to **Intruder**.

Select the parameter value (`1`), remove it, and click **Add** to mark it as a payload position.

Step 6:

In `Payloads`, choose:

- Payload type → **Numbers**
- From: **0**
- To: 100
- Step: 1

Step 7:

Go to `Grep **–** Match`.

Enable it and:

- Remove any existing match strings.
- Add: picoCTF
- Enable Case **sensitive** (optional but clean).

Step 8:

Start the attack.

Intruder will try all values 0–100.

When a response contains the flag, the picoCTF match **column** will show  1 

Step 9:

Select the request where a match appears.

Open the response tab — the flag is inside that response
